        Astrological consultations are subjective, and different astrologers may
        provide varying results. Credits spent are intended to compensate
        Astrologer Partners for their time and effort, and not for any specific
        output. No refunds will be issued for any inaccuracies, incorrectness,
        or fallacies in predictions, advice, or remedies provided during
        consultations.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are dissatisfied with the Services, you may contact customer care
        within seven days, explaining the reasons for your dissatisfaction.
        <br />
        <br />
        Customer care representatives will verify your complaint, accessing
        necessary information, and may request further details. The Company will
        make efforts to gather this information within five business days.
        <br />
        <br />
        Customer care representatives will determine if your dissatisfaction is
        due to specific circumstances, such as call disturbances, language
        issues, delays, or irrelevant responses.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your dissatisfaction arises from the circumstances mentioned above, a
        refund of corresponding Credits will be initiated to your Account after
        deducting applicable charges. Refunds will be credited to your in-app
        credits.
        <br />
        <br />
        All other transactions related to the Services are final and
        non-refundable.
